# PF2e Level Up Wizard

A module for PF2e on FoundryVTT that provides a level up assistant for players.

## Installation

This module can be installed directly in Foundry via `Install Modules` and searching for the name. Alternatively you can install it via manifest using this link: `https://github.com/BenABaron/pf2e-level-up-wizard/releases/latest/download/module.json`

## Usage

Once the module is enabled, players will see a wizard hat appear on their character sheets next to their level. This can be moved to the window's toolbar in the settings.
When it's time to level up, simply click the wizard hat to start up the Level-Up Wizard.

The wizard will show the player any new feature they gained with their level up, as well as prompting them to make any relevant selections if available.
Follow the steps on screen, hit submit (and confirm!), and watch as the wizard handles all of the necessary changes to the character sheet!

The wizard even sends confirmation messages in chat, as well as whispers to individual players about any changes they need to make manually!

## Contributing

I'm always happy to accept contribution from others! If you'd like to contribute, please follow these guidelines:

- Create branch out of latest `main` branch. Make sure to do a `git pull origin/main` for latest copy.
- Branch names should be a description of the feature being implemented/bug being fixed (i.e. `my-feature`, `bug-123-bug-summary`), preferring dashes over camelCasing in branch names.
- When ready for review, open a PR from your feature branch against `main`.
